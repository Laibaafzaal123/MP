<p>Lily was a little girl</p>
<p>Afraid of the big, wide world</p>
    <p>She grew up within her castle walls</p>
<p>Now and then, she tried to run</p>
  <p>And then on a night with the setting sun</p>
 <p>She went in the woods away</p>
    <p>So afraid, all alone</p>
        <p>They warned her, don't go there</p>
            <p>There's creatures who are hidin' in the dark</p>
                <p>Then somethin' came creepin'</p>
                    <p>It told her, "Don't you worry, " just Follow everywhere I go</p>
                        <p>Top of all the mountains or valley low</p>
                            <p>Give you everything you've been dreamin' of</p>
  <p>Just let me in, ooh</p>
<p>Everything you want in gold</p>
    <p>I'll be the magic story you've been told</p>
        <p>And you'll be safe under my control</p>
            <p>Just let me in, ooh</p>
                <p>Just let me in, ooh</p>
                    <p>She knew she was hypnotized</p></p>
                        <p>And walking on cold, thin ice</p>
                            <p>Then it broke, and she awoke again</p>
 <p>Then she ran faster and</p>
    <p>Start screamin', "Is there someone out there?</p>
        <p>Please help me, come get me"</p>
            <p>Behind her, she can hear it say</p>
                <p>Follow everywhere I go</p>
                    <p>Top of all the mountains or valley low</p>
                        <p>Give you everything you've been dreamin' of</p>
                            <p>Just let me in, ooh</p>
                                <p>Everything you want in gold</p>
  <p>I'll be the magic story you've been told</p>
    <p>And you'll be safe under my control</p>
